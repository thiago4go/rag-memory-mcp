An advanced MCP server for **RAG-enabled memory** through a knowledge graph with **vector search** capabilities. This server extends the basic memory concepts with semantic search, document processing, and hybrid retrieval for more intelligent memory management.

**üÜï NEW: Full PostgreSQL Support** - Now supports both SQLite (default) and PostgreSQL databases with automatic adapter switching, production-ready performance optimizations, and pgvector integration for enterprise deployments.

**Inspired by:** [Knowledge Graph Memory Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory) from the Model Context Protocol project.

**Note:** This server is designed to run locally alongside MCP clients (e.g., Claude Desktop, VS Code) and requires local file system access for database storage.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üß† Knowledge Graph Memory**: Persistent entities, relationships, and observations
- **üîç Vector Search**: Semantic similarity search using sentence transformers
- **üìÑ Document Processing**: RAG-enabled document chunking and embedding
- **üîó Hybrid Search**: Combines vector similarity with graph traversal
- **üóÑÔ∏è Dual Database Support**: 
  - **SQLite**: Fast local storage with sqlite-vec for vector operations (default)
  - **PostgreSQL**: Production-ready with pgvector, JSONB, and advanced indexing
- **üéØ Entity Extraction**: Automatic term extraction from documents
- **üîÑ Automated Database Migrations**: Multi-database migration system with schema versioning
- **‚ö° Production Ready**: Connection pooling, transaction management, and performance optimizations

## Tools

This server provides comprehensive memory management through the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

### üìö Document Management
- `storeDocument`: Store documents with automatic chunking and embedding generation
- `extractTerms`: Extract potential entity terms from documents
- `linkEntitiesToDocument`: Create explicit entity-document associations
- `deleteDocuments`: Remove documents and associated data
- `listDocuments`: View all stored documents with metadata

### üß† Knowledge Graph
- `createEntities`: Create new entities with observations and types
- `createRelations`: Establish relationships between entities. (If linked entities don't exist, they are automatically created).
- `addObservations`: Add contextual information to existing entities
- `deleteEntities`: Remove entities and their relationships
- `deleteRelations`: Remove specific relationships
- `deleteObservations`: Remove specific observations from entities
- `reEmbedEverything`: Re-embed all entities, document chunks, and knowledge graph chunks (e.g., after an embedding model update or for data consistency).

### üîç Search & Retrieval
- `hybridSearch`: Advanced search that first performs a semantic search for relevant nodes (entities and/or document chunks via the enhanced `searchNodes` tool) and then, if enabled via its `useGraph` parameter, enhances these results with knowledge graph traversal for superior contextual understanding.
- `searchNodes`: Finds nodes (entities, document chunks, etc.) using semantic vector similarity based on a natural language query. Can specify `nodeTypesToSearch` (e.g., `["entity"]`, `["documentChunk"]`) or defaults to searching both.
- `openNodes`: Retrieve specific entities and their relationships
- `readGraph`: Get complete knowledge graph structure
- `getDetailedContext`: Retrieve detailed context for a specific chunk, including surrounding content (often used after `hybridSearch`).

### üìä Analytics
- `getKnowledgeGraphStats`: Comprehensive statistics about the knowledge base and RAG system.

## Usage Scenarios

This server is ideal for scenarios requiring intelligent memory and document understanding:

- **Research and Documentation**: Store, process, and intelligently retrieve research papers
- **Knowledge Base Construction**: Build interconnected knowledge from documents
- **Conversational Memory**: Remember context across chat sessions with semantic understanding
- **Content Analysis**: Extract and relate concepts from large document collections
- **Intelligent Assistance**: Provide contextually aware responses based on stored knowledge

## Client Configuration

This section explains how to configure MCP clients to use the `rag-memory-mcp` server.

### Usage with Claude Desktop / Cursor

Add the following configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude Desktop) or `mcp.json` (Cursor):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rag-memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "rag-memory-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**With specific version:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rag-memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "rag-memory-mcp@1.0.0"]
    }
  }
}
```

**With custom database path:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rag-memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "rag-memory-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_DB_PATH": "/path/to/custom/memory.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with VS Code

Add the following configuration to your User Settings (JSON) file or `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "rag-memory-mcp": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "rag-memory-mcp"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Entities
Entities are the primary nodes in the knowledge graph. Each entity has:
- A unique name (identifier)
- An entity type (e.g., "PERSON", "CONCEPT", "TECHNOLOGY")
- A list of observations (contextual information)

Example:
```json
{
  "name": "Machine Learning",
  "entityType": "CONCEPT",
  "observations": [
    "Subset of artificial intelligence",
    "Focuses on learning from data",
    "Used in recommendation systems"
  ]
}
```

### Relations
Relations define directed connections between entities, describing how they interact:

Example:
```json
{
  "from": "React",
  "to": "JavaScript",
  "relationType": "BUILT_WITH"
}
```

### Observations
Observations are discrete pieces of information about entities:
- Stored as strings
- Attached to specific entities
- Can be added or removed independently
- Should be atomic (one fact per observation)

### Documents & Vector Search
Documents are automatically processed through:
1. **Storage**: Raw text with metadata
2. **Chunking**: Automatically split into manageable pieces
3. **Embedding**: Automatically convert to vector representations
4. **Linking**: Associate with relevant entities

This enables **hybrid search** that combines:
- Vector similarity (semantic matching)
- Graph traversal (conceptual relationships)

## Database Configuration

This server supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases with automatic adapter switching based on environment configuration.

### SQLite (Default)
Perfect for development and lightweight deployments:

```json

      "env": {
        "DB_TYPE": "sqlite",
        "DB_FILE_PATH": "/path/to/custom/memory.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
