Create multiple new entities in the knowledge graph with comprehensive metadata and observations.
**Essential for building the foundational structure of your knowledge representation.**
Use this tool to add new concepts, people, places, or any identifiable objects to your graph.
**Automatically generates vector embeddings** for semantic search capabilities.
</description>

<importantNotes>
- (!important!) **Entities are the building blocks** of your knowledge graph - use descriptive names
- (!important!) EntityType helps categorize and filter entities (e.g., PERSON, CONCEPT, PLACE, TECHNOLOGY)
- (!important!) Observations provide context and evidence for the entity's existence or properties
- (!important!) **Avoid duplicate entities** - check if similar entities exist first using search_nodes
- (!important!) **Vector embeddings are automatically generated** for semantic search
</importantNotes>

<whenToUseThisTool>
- When introducing new concepts, people, or objects into your knowledge base
- When processing documents and need to extract and formalize key entities

const createRelationsDescription: ToolRegistrationDescription = () => `<description>
Create multiple relationships between entities in the knowledge graph to establish connections and semantic links.
**Critical for building the interconnected structure that makes knowledge graphs powerful.**
Relationships define how entities relate to each other, enabling graph traversal and inference.
</description>

<importantNotes>
- (!important!) **Both entities must exist** before creating relationships - entities are auto-created if missing
- (!important!) Relationship types should be consistent and meaningful (e.g., IS_A, HAS, USES, IMPLEMENTS)
- (!important!) Direction matters: "from" â†’ "to" represents the relationship direction
- (!important!) **Avoid redundant relationships** - check existing connections first
</importantNotes>

<whenToUseThisTool>
- When establishing semantic connections between concepts
- After creating entities that should be connected
- When processing text that implies relationships

Add new observations to existing entities to continuously enrich their context, evidence, and understanding.
**Essential for keeping your knowledge graph current and comprehensive.**
Observations provide the factual foundation that supports entity existence and properties.
</description>

<importantNotes>
- (!important!) **Entity must exist** - this tool only adds to existing entities
- (!important!) Only new observations are added - duplicates are automatically filtered
- (!important!) Observations are cumulative - they build the entity's knowledge base

<whenToUseThisTool>
- When you discover new information about existing entities
- After processing additional documents that mention known entities
- When updating entity knowledge from new sources

const hybridSearchDescription: ToolRegistrationDescription = () => `<description>
Perform sophisticated hybrid search. This tool first uses semantic similarity (via the enhanced 'searchNodes' tool) to find relevant entities and/or document chunks, and then, if enabled, enhances these results with knowledge graph traversal for superior contextual understanding.
**The most powerful search tool in the system** - leverages both initial semantic similarity and structural relationships from the graph.
Perfect for complex queries that benefit from both direct content matching and broader conceptual connections.
</description>

<importantNotes>
- (!important!) **Hybrid approach is more powerful** than pure vector or graph search alone due to its two-stage process.
- (!important!) Initial semantic search leverages the versatile 'searchNodes' tool to find relevant base items (entities, documents).
- (!important!) Graph enhancement (controlled by 'useGraph') then finds related concepts and connections even if not directly matched in the initial semantic search.
- (!important!) Results include similarity scores, graph boost indicators, and hybrid rankings.
- (!important!) **Best results when knowledge graph is well-populated** with entities and relationships to support the enhancement stage.
</importantNotes>

<whenToUseThisTool>
- When you need comprehensive search across documents and knowledge, with an emphasis on graph-based connections.
- For complex queries requiring deep conceptual understanding beyond initial semantic matches.
- When exploring relationships between concepts surfaced by an initial search.
- **Before making decisions** - to gather all relevant information, including indirectly related items found via graph traversal.
- When researching topics that span multiple domains and require connecting disparate pieces of information.
- For discovery of implicit connections and patterns that simple semantic search might miss.
</whenToUseThisTool>

<features>
- Initial semantic similarity search across specified node types (entities, documents) via 'searchNodes'.
- Optional knowledge graph traversal for conceptual enhancement and discovery of related items.
- Hybrid scoring combining multiple relevance signals (initial similarity, graph boost).
- Entity association highlighting based on graph connections.
- Configurable result limits and graph usage.
- Rich result metadata with multiple ranking scores.
</features>

<bestPractices>
- Use natural language queries rather than just keywords.
- Enable graph enhancement ('useGraph': true) for better conceptual coverage and discovery of related information.
- Start with broader queries, then narrow down based on results from both semantic search and graph enhancement.
- Review entity associations to understand how graph traversal contributed to the results.
- Use appropriate limits based on your analysis needs.
- Combine with other tools like 'getDetailedContext' or 'openNodes' for comprehensive knowledge exploration of the hybrid results.
</bestPractices>

<parameters>
- query: Natural language search query (string, required) - passed to initial semantic search.
- limit: Maximum results to return, default 5 (number, optional) - influences initial search and final output.
- useGraph: Enable knowledge graph enhancement after initial semantic search, default true (boolean, optional).
</parameters>

<examples>
- Conceptual search with graph enhancement: {"query": "machine learning applications in healthcare", "limit": 10, "useGraph": true}
- Technical research with graph enhancement: {"query": "React performance optimization techniques", "useGraph": true}
- Discovery mode with graph enhancement: {"query": "Einstein's contributions to modern physics", "limit": 15, "useGraph": true}
- Semantic search of documents/entities *without* graph enhancement: {"query": "quantum computing advantages", "limit": 3, "useGraph": false} (relies on 'searchNodes' broad default)
