Create multiple new entities in the knowledge graph with comprehensive metadata and observations.
**Essential for building the foundational structure of your knowledge representation.**
Use this tool to add new concepts, people, places, or any identifiable objects to your graph.
</description>

<importantNotes>
- (!important!) **Entities are the building blocks** of your knowledge graph - use descriptive names
- (!important!) EntityType helps categorize and filter entities (e.g., PERSON, CONCEPT, PLACE, TECHNOLOGY)
- (!important!) Observations provide context and evidence for the entity's existence or properties
- (!important!) **Avoid duplicate entities** - check if similar entities exist first using search_nodes
</importantNotes>

<whenToUseThisTool>
- When introducing new concepts, people, or objects into your knowledge base
- When processing documents and need to extract and formalize key entities
- When building domain-specific knowledge representations

- When migrating knowledge from other systems into the graph
</whenToUseThisTool>

<features>
- Batch creation of multiple entities in a single operation
- Automatic unique ID generation based on entity names
- Support for custom entity types for domain categorization

const createRelationsDescription: ToolRegistrationDescription = () => `<description>
Create multiple relationships between entities in the knowledge graph to establish connections and semantic links.
**Critical for building the interconnected structure that makes knowledge graphs powerful.**
Relationships define how entities relate to each other, enabling graph traversal and inference.
</description>

<importantNotes>
- (!important!) **Both entities must exist** before creating relationships - entities are auto-created if missing
- (!important!) Relationship types should be consistent and meaningful (e.g., IS_A, HAS, USES, IMPLEMENTS)

- (!important!) **Avoid redundant relationships** - check existing connections first
</importantNotes>

<whenToUseThisTool>
- When establishing semantic connections between concepts
- After creating entities that should be connected
- When processing text that implies relationships
